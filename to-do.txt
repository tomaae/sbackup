- option to remove version in backup history
- start restore from backup history

- use same rotating method for single version backup, safety in case of backup failure (half written data)
- on delete backup, remove all versions, remove log and history retention, no longer needed
- restore into different location
- show progress wheel on running like with Filesystes> Status when formating

- settings, only one backup at once > queuing
- settings, only one backup to one target datastore at once > queuing
- restart failed backups once

- forbid changing backup source
- forbid changing backup target, add migration button

- get versions should check if version data dir exists
=================================================================
- "mv" data migration. started with "at", change state to "migrating", creates lockfile with old source for restart in case of failure
- on "edit retention", delete old copies started with "at", change state to "migrating", creates lockfile with old source for restart in case of failure
- import backup. save backup configuration within backup_uuid folder

- backup configuration (backup specifications and backup history) after each backup, restore via settings tab (backup history log copy and omv config import in same way as postinst)
=================================================================
- schedule Purge
- checkbox, run purge after backup
